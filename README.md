# Sui-Ed-Credentials-PH-Decentralized-Academic-Verification
An open-source framework for Philippine schools to issue secure, decentralized digital diplomas and transcripts using the Sui blockchain.
​Status: Ideation & Architecture Phase > We are currently building the conceptual framework and architecture for this project. Developers, educators, and Web3 enthusiasts are welcome to contribute!
​. Overview
​The integrity of academic credentials in the Philippines faces systemic challenges—from the proliferation of "diploma mills" to the slow, manual verification processes required by employers and government agencies (like the CAV process).
​Sui-Ed Credentials PH is an open-source, hybrid Web2/Web3 architecture designed to issue mathematically verifiable, tamper-proof academic credentials. By leveraging the Sui blockchain's object-centric model, schools can issue Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) to graduates. This system shifts the burden of trust from easily forged paper documents to an immutable decentralized ledger.
​. The Vision
​Instead of reinventing the wheel, this project is designed to integrate seamlessly as a new module within existing PHP/SQL-based school management systems.
​For Students: Total ownership of their digital diplomas, securely held in a self-custodial Sui wallet.
​For Employers: Instant, zero-cost verification of a candidate's educational background.
​For DepEd/CHED: A modernized, automated registry where only whitelisted institutions hold the cryptographic authority to mint credentials.
​. Hybrid Architecture
​1. The Web2 Layer (School Management Integration)
​Frontend: Standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript dashboards for class advisers, registrars, and students.
​Backend: PHP handles the core business logic, user authentication, and data formatting.
​Database: A relational SQL database stores everyday, granular data (grades, attendance, daily schedules) to keep on-chain costs near zero.
​2. The Middleware Layer
​Sui TypeScript SDK: A lightweight Node.js microservice bridges the PHP backend to the Sui network.
​Data Hashing: The PHP backend hashes the student's final Transcript of Records (e.g., using SHA-256) and passes only this lightweight string to the blockchain.
​3. The Web3 Layer (Sui Network)
​Smart Contracts (Sui Move): Handles the creation of AcademicCredential objects.
​Soulbound Tokens: Credentials lack the store ability, meaning they cannot be sold or transferred once minted to a student.
​Role-Based Access (AdminCap): Only authorized wallet addresses (acting as the school registrar under DepEd/CHED authority) can execute the minting function.
​. Roadmap & Milestones
​This project is being built in public. Here is our current roadmap:
​[ ] Phase 1: Architecture & Ideation
​[x] Define hybrid Web2/Web3 flow.
​[x] Draft initial Sui Move smart contract logic.
​[ ] Design SQL database schema for student graduation records.
​[ ] Phase 2: Web2 Prototyping
​[ ] Build the HTML/CSS/JS frontend UI for the Registrar Dashboard.
​[ ] Write PHP scripts to generate SHA-256 hashes from SQL grade data.
​[ ] Phase 3: Web3 Integration
​[ ] Deploy the Sui Move smart contract to the Sui Testnet.
​[ ] Integrate the Sui TypeScript SDK to connect the frontend to Sui wallets (like Sui Wallet or Surf).
​[ ] Phase 4: Pilot Testing
​[ ] Mint the first testnet Soulbound Diploma.
​[ ] Build the public verification portal for employers.
